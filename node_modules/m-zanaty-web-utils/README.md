# m-zanaty-web-utils

most of the time u stuck on creating the node project using typescript with this tool you will be able in seconds scaffold your project with all the stuff you need like

ðŸš€ Prettier
ðŸš€ Eslint
ðŸš€ Typescript Configuration
ðŸš€ Jasmine integration
ðŸš€ Basic API with testing

to use the tool open follow the next steps and follow the instruction

```shell
npm i -g m-zanaty-web-utils
mkdir PROJECT_NAME
